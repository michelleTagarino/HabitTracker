What is Habit Tracker?
——————————————————————
Habit Tracker is an open source application that may be used by a single user at a time
to record, complete, and track their habits. Habits may be anything that the user does
in his/her spare time. 


How to use it?
——————————————————————
The app will prompt the user to view a list of their habits. Here, the user may enter 
the name of their habit in the text box at the bottom. When they press the ADD HABIT
button, the app will prompt the user to check the weekdays that the habit may be 
completed. Each item may be long clicked to provide the option to delete or complete
the habit. In the app menu bar at the top, the user can view a list of the habits that
he/she has already completed. Any habit can be completed more than once. The user may
also delete past habit completions as well.
